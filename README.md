# Introduction
***
The purpose of this project is to perform the ETL steps that would be required, and some basic analysis to understand if the weather in a given area has an affect on local yelp reviews.

For this project, I've used the YELP review data set and weather data for New York City.

I will be loading this data into Snowflake and performing the proper ETL required to analyze this data in a downstream system.
